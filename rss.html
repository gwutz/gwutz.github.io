            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Constructor attribute for shared libraries</h1>
<p>I often read source code of different projects. Especially when i use them often
like glib. I realized that glib has a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">glib-init</span></span> file and wondered because
i never had to call any initialization. Therefore this must be called by
another mechanism.</p>
<p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">glib-init.c</span></span> includes a header called <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gconstructor.h</span></span> which i know already
from another project: <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnome-builder</span></span>. The header got probably copied but both
projects use this for the same purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>execute a function to initialize a library on library-loading.</div></blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice feature, which is not documented in the c standard.
It is an extension from C compilers. If we read up the documentation we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__attribute__((constructor))</span></span></p>
<p>The constructor attribute causes the function to be called automatically
before execution enters main ().</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The aforementioned header tries to comply to various compilers or at least
sets a preprocessor value to inform the user about missing functionality for
this constructor attribute. As mentioned in the header file:</p>
<div class="code c highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="c1">#ifdef G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR_NEEDS_PRAGMA</span>
<span class="c1">#pragma G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR_PRAGMA_ARGS(my_constructor)</span>
<span class="c1">#endif</span>
<span class="n">G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_constructor</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">static</span> <span class="n">void</span> <span class="n">my_constructor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>To demonstrate this, i created a simple example application with a shared
library. The library looks like:</p>
<div class="code c highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="c1">#include "gconstructor.h"</span>

<span class="n">G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">this_runs_before_main</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">void</span>
<span class="n">this_runs_before_main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Before main"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">void</span>
<span class="n">library_func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Library Func"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I annotated one function with a constructor attribute. The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">library_func</span></span> is
exposed via the corresponding headerfile. The executable looks like:</p>
<div class="code c highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="c1">#include "library.h"</span>

<span class="nb">int</span>
<span class="n">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span>   <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Main"</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="n">library_func</span> <span class="p">();</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Not very surprising the output looks like</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">Before</span> <span class="n">main</span>
<span class="n">Main</span>
<span class="n">Library</span> <span class="n">Func</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>meson test is parallel</h1>
<p>Today i searched half of the day for a super strange bug in my library
development project. I wanted to build this library as a TDD library
to get the hang of working from the API caller side first. Therefore i always
build my tests before i write the working code.</p>
<p>My library has business layer with interfaces to all sides so i basically don’t
care which implementation i use and i can act dynamically when i want a different
backend for example. My implementation for the database layer is a sqlite
one and this specific module was failing all the day. The interesting part
is: it was just failing in a specific test order of my library tests. I was
super confused because i got a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">database</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">locked</span></span> error when i created
my table scheme in one of my tests. The same call from former tests succeeded
so there has to be a problem with opening and closing of my database. I checked
every call to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlite_open</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlite_close</span></span> and checked the return code
of these calls but it looked like everything is fine.</p>
<p>Sqlite allows multiple reader in different connections but only one writer.
The statement which failed in my test suite was a</p>
<div class="code sql highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">CREATE</span> <span class="n">TABLE</span> <span class="n">IS</span> <span class="n">NOT</span> <span class="n">EXISTS</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I think this gets always interpreted as a write even if the database already
has that table. What me really bothered was the ordering removed this error
and i thought i have a really terrible closing error in my library. But then
i realized that maybe it has nothing todo with my library. I knowed that i
can configure meson to use more processes for testing. I consulted the
meson reference and saw this statement about unit tests:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To reduce test times, Meson will by default run multiple unit tests in parallel.</div></blockquote>
<p>This was the culprint. Tests which use my database even when i don’t test
specifically my database are run in parallel which means multiple writer. A
reordering can help - but would be a fragile solution. Disabling parallelism
for some unit tests was the solution after all. So keep that in mind, when
you try TDD - know your buildsystem, tap runner and environment!</p>
