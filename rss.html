            <description><![CDATA[<h1>amsel - the next attempt</h1>
<p>Most of the time i try to sharpen my skills regarding software development.
There is so much to learn and i really want to get considered good enough in
this field. Therefore i often try to experiment with new insights and advices
from books or talks to try kind of development and learn from these experiments.</p>
<p>For example last year i experimented with my knowledge reading up the source
code of <a class="reference external" href="http://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-builder">gnome-builder</a> and
contributing small patches to build my own application in C. I saw, there are
ideas around to have a GNOME RSS reader and i rebuilt therefore GNOME News. This
was a nice experiment and i got nice comments about it. I ended up in some
problems with my choice of architecture. It seemed like i made some mistakes
here and there and the usage of libgrss had problems too (it seemed not
maintained anymore and i had no idea how that library worked internally).</p>
<p>Coming out of this development i had the feeling, that i have to structure such
an application more and should start with requirements first before i start
developing. In the meantime i made attempts to have a GtkFlowBox with headers
which ended up in a way which could work but is probably inperformant. Talking
with some people at GUADEC made me feel like there are ideas about such a
widget and people really want performance for List/FlowBox inside Gtk. There
will be eventually a hackfest working on this (but there is no date at the
moment).</p>
<p>One of my problems at my first and second attempt was that i really want to
mix up a traditional offline RSS/Atom reader with an online service like feedly.
But the former speaks only xml and the latter JSON. All my implementations
where based on the input data and then i saw a talk from uncle Bob. He talked
about an abstraced way for your application. Just implement the business logic
and get the data in a simple format. This idea is similar to the unix
philosophy which basically states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Write programs that do one thing and do it well</li>
<li>Write programs to work together</li>
<li>Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is the same like that from uncle Bob. This was a really nice
idea which i wanted to test out. I took most of my code from former experiments
and created a library called <strong>alb</strong> (AmseLBackend) which is the core driver
for my application. It wraps data in a simple <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AmselRequest</span></span> object which
is raw data. It tries to determine the kind of data (which could be RSS, ATOM or
JSON) and enters this data to a engine which returns usable data objects. The
gui code is rather simple because of that (at the moment i only have 3 files)
and i think this a good architecture to work forward. As i don’t want to write
all this without a little showcase, this is my pre-alpha <strong>Amsel</strong> application.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Constructor attribute for shared libraries</h1>
<p>I often read source code of different projects. Especially when i use them often
like glib. I realized that glib has a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">glib-init</span></span> file and wondered because
i never had to call any initialization. Therefore this must be called by
another mechanism.</p>
<p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">glib-init.c</span></span> includes a header called <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gconstructor.h</span></span> which i know already
from another project: <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnome-builder</span></span>. The header got probably copied but both
projects use this for the same purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>execute a function to initialize a library on library-loading.</div></blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice feature, which is not documented in the c standard.
It is an extension from C compilers. If we read up the documentation we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__attribute__((constructor))</span></span></p>
<p>The constructor attribute causes the function to be called automatically
before execution enters main ().</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The aforementioned header tries to comply to various compilers or at least
sets a preprocessor value to inform the user about missing functionality for
this constructor attribute. As mentioned in the header file:</p>
<div class="code c highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="c1">#ifdef G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR_NEEDS_PRAGMA</span>
<span class="c1">#pragma G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR_PRAGMA_ARGS(my_constructor)</span>
<span class="c1">#endif</span>
<span class="n">G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_constructor</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">static</span> <span class="n">void</span> <span class="n">my_constructor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">void</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>To demonstrate this, i created a simple example application with a shared
library. The library looks like:</p>
<div class="code c highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="c1">#include "gconstructor.h"</span>

<span class="n">G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">this_runs_before_main</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">void</span>
<span class="n">this_runs_before_main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Before main"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">void</span>
<span class="n">library_func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Library Func"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I annotated one function with a constructor attribute. The <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">library_func</span></span> is
exposed via the corresponding headerfile. The executable looks like:</p>
<div class="code c highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="c1">#include "library.h"</span>

<span class="nb">int</span>
<span class="n">main</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span>   <span class="n">argc</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[])</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">printf</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Main"</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="n">library_func</span> <span class="p">();</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Not very surprising the output looks like</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">Before</span> <span class="n">main</span>
<span class="n">Main</span>
<span class="n">Library</span> <span class="n">Func</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>meson test is parallel</h1>
<p>Today i searched half of the day for a super strange bug in my library
development project. I wanted to build this library as a TDD library
to get the hang of working from the API caller side first. Therefore i always
build my tests before i write the working code.</p>
<p>My library has business layer with interfaces to all sides so i basically don’t
care which implementation i use and i can act dynamically when i want a different
backend for example. My implementation for the database layer is a sqlite
one and this specific module was failing all the day. The interesting part
is: it was just failing in a specific test order of my library tests. I was
super confused because i got a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">database</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">locked</span></span> error when i created
my table scheme in one of my tests. The same call from former tests succeeded
so there has to be a problem with opening and closing of my database. I checked
every call to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlite_open</span></span> and <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sqlite_close</span></span> and checked the return code
of these calls but it looked like everything is fine.</p>
<p>Sqlite allows multiple reader in different connections but only one writer.
The statement which failed in my test suite was a</p>
<div class="code sql highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/><span class="n">CREATE</span> <span class="n">TABLE</span> <span class="n">IS</span> <span class="n">NOT</span> <span class="n">EXISTS</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I think this gets always interpreted as a write even if the database already
has that table. What me really bothered was the ordering removed this error
and i thought i have a really terrible closing error in my library. But then
i realized that maybe it has nothing todo with my library. I knowed that i
can configure meson to use more processes for testing. I consulted the
meson reference and saw this statement about unit tests:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>To reduce test times, Meson will by default run multiple unit tests in parallel.</div></blockquote>
<p>This was the culprint. Tests which use my database even when i don’t test
specifically my database are run in parallel which means multiple writer. A
reordering can help - but would be a fragile solution. Disabling parallelism
for some unit tests was the solution after all. So keep that in mind, when
you try TDD - know your buildsystem, tap runner and environment!</p>
