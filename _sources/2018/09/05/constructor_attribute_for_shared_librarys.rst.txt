Constructor attribute for shared libraries
==========================================

I often read source code of different projects. Especially when i use them often
like glib. I realized that glib has a ``glib-init`` file and wondered because
i never had to call any initialization. Therefore this must be called by
another mechanism.

``glib-init.c`` includes a header called ``gconstructor.h`` which i know already
from another project: ``gnome-builder``. The header got probably copied but both
projects use this for the same purpose:

	execute a function to initialize a library on library-loading.

This is a really nice feature, which is not documented in the c standard.
It is an extension from C compilers. If we read up the documentation we get:

	``__attribute__((constructor))``

	The constructor attribute causes the function to be called automatically
	before execution enters main ().

The aforementioned header tries to comply to various compilers or at least
sets a preprocessor value to inform the user about missing functionality for
this constructor attribute. As mentioned in the header file:


.. code:: c

	#ifdef G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR_NEEDS_PRAGMA
	#pragma G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR_PRAGMA_ARGS(my_constructor)
	#endif
	G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR(my_constructor)
	static void my_constructor(void) {
	...
	}

Example
-------

To demonstrate this, i created a simple example application with a shared
library. The library looks like:

.. code:: c

	#include "gconstructor.h"

	G_DEFINE_CONSTRUCTOR (this_runs_before_main)

	void
	this_runs_before_main (void)
	{
	  printf ("%s\n", "Before main");
	}

	void
	library_func (void)
	{
	  printf ("%s\n", "Library Func");
	}

I annotated one function with a constructor attribute. The ``library_func`` is
exposed via the corresponding headerfile. The executable looks like:

.. code:: c

	#include "library.h"

	int
	main (int   argc,
	      char *argv[])
	{
	  printf ("%s\n", "Main");

	  library_func ();

	  return 0;
	}

Not very surprising the output looks like

.. code-block:: c

	Before main
	Main
	Library Func
